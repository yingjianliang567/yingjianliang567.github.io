## Design

- **UPenn-style header.** Two-tier sticky header with a frosted-glass blur and an oversized Penn wordmark.
- **Dark mode.** One-click toggle that follows the system preference and is remembered across visits.
- **Living timeline.** Entries light up as they scroll into view; the current role carries a Penn-red pulse.
- **Scroll-reveal cards.** News and publication cards fade in as they enter the viewport.
- **Deliberate typography.** System sans for display, PT Serif for long-form reading.
- **Mobile-tuned.** Responsive layout with a compact fixed header and touch-friendly cards.
- **No frameworks.** Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript on top of Jekyll.

The site uses the official Penn palette: Penn Blue for structure (headings, links, the timeline) and Penn Red as a scarce accent (the heading underline, the current-role pulse). Dark mode swaps in lighter tints of both to preserve contrast.

## Deployment

  <img src=".github/assets/pipeline-light.svg" alt="Pipeline: content written in Markdown, built by Jekyll, deployed by GitHub Pages, served to the visitor" width="100%">

Edit Markdown, push to `main`, and GitHub Pages rebuilds and publishes the site, usually within a minute.

## Local development

Requires Ruby 3.3 (see `.ruby-version`) and Bundler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LarrySimingDeng/larrysimingdeng.github.io.git
cd larrysimingdeng.github.io

bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
# http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

> [!TIP]
> Comment out the `url:` field in `_config.yml` while previewing locally so absolute URLs resolve to `localhost` instead of production.
